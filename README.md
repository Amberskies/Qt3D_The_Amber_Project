# Qt3D_The_Amber_Project
Long Term Game Project useing Qt3D  in VS2017 with the Qt VS Tools

1a Basic Files Created for a Server.
1b Basic Files Created for a window.

2 Basic Client Log on recognition test use Acount 99 as Admin log on

3 Asset Management - develope a simple Asset Storage and Loading system.

Re-Evaluated Development needs - so all this is going to be split up into Bite sized Projects
Each Project will be 1 Part of a full 3D engine and conpiled as a Static Lib

then tested and developed properly.


So....

4 Split Up the Project !
Much better in terms of development now - here's a look at my notes :

/* Notes 
Basic Setup to show and close a window complete.
created a Camera3D and added a Transform3D class to SL_Graphics
- silly me made the OpenGL version - oh well - i'll leave them for later perhaps.
so... 
	User Input created
	 the FPS 3D movement is NOT in its final form
	 this is very basic movement for testing more than anything
	 the 2.5D movement is only usefull when viewing to the SouthEast = +x, +z
		it will also need to be expanded for other viewpoints
so.. we have all we need now to continue and test a Terrain.
********************************************
TODO:
	... Lets get on with Terrain
	This will lead into better Asset Management
	and aiming for an Atlas of Maps - ooer - (a full Planet maybe ?????)
	- well they did say aim hight and enjoy whatever results - smiles.

and.....

5. Onwards into Terrain development.
