Please remember to check Microsoft and Qt's Terms and Conditions if you

1a Basic Files Created for a Server.
1b Basic Files Created for a window.

check the Client_Dev1 for development updates.

Release 1 : a very basic Static Lib created useing QT3D
  Try it out and have fun - basic Games can easily be evolved from this code.
  
Release 2 : Basic Static Lib with first Tests with HeightMap Generation
	Known issue with tree texturing - see main.cpp notes.

	**********************************************************

Final Release 3 :

The Way Forwards :
	Stage 1 : A Libre Office Spread Sheet has been added showing the bare bones structure.
			  At this stage it could be altered or re-jigged as I go along, but its a guide
			  for what to expect.

stage 2 : move all current files into new structure.
	Filers updated.
	Folders Updated
	Files Moved - Ready for Merge.

	Dummy files added so that Github will record the full directory Structure.

stage 3 : merge existing files into useable Simple Generic Files
	- probably means creating new Front end files like WorldManager for the user.
	and then layering our code into directories.

Stage 4 : check Refactoring useing a full Test

Stage 5 : RETHINK and do 1-4 AGAIN !

Stage 6 : repeat stage 5 if not happy - else Tidy up and FINISH !
